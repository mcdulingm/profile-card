## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to build the design of a Profile Card Component, using any solution. It needs to match the original design as much as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I tried to use the BEM naming convention for this project but it can definitly be improved.

### Continued development

I should work on improving my class namings and do better planning for my layouts.
